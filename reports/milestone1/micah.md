1. What would you like me to specifically grade you on?
  * Completion of required elements with clean understandability.

2. What were your experiences and difficulties with this assignment?
  * The project goal evolved from developing a standalone system from the ground up to contributing to an existing open source project. I much prefer the latter. 
  * The main difficulty was in searching for a database of known CVE listings on projects. Consideration of the CII Census project proved unfruitful as it seemed most of their data was static and not dynamically gathered. However, this roadblock was alleviated by the discovery of the National Vulnerability Database and the ability to ping it to check whether a software package has been marked with a potential vulnerability.
